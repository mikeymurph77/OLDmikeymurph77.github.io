I think you missed the ‚ÄòStart‚Äô of 2019‚Äù.Well you‚Äôre right, and we‚Äôll get to that. But let‚Äôs just jump into it.\nIt‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been working professionally as a Ruby on Rails developer for 4 years now. It has been a great experience, andlearning this language and framework has been life changing.Call it a first love, comfort, or even complacency, but it‚Äôs about time that I move on to the next language/framework so I can continue to grow as a developer.\nAs microservices become more of the norm, it is best to dive head first into this new design technique. \n2019 will be the year I take on learning and mastering Java, the Spring framework, and all the other technologies that surround the microservice ecosystem‚Ä¶ Hello Kubernetes and Docker. \nThese technologies are battle tested and not going anywhere anytime soon. So it‚Äôs been fun Ruby/Rails, but I must spread my wings and fly.\nGrow your brain!My father would always tell us to ‚ÄúHave fun and grow your brain!‚Äù before we went to school each day. I always thought this was a bit corny, but it was a good reminder that learning can be fun if you have the right perspective.\nAs I got older that message slipped and learning became a chore.\nI‚Äôm starting 2019 with this message fresh in mind. I have a lot to learn, and yes some of these topics are as dry as Spongebob when he entered Sandy‚Äôs bio-dome without water. If I have the right perspective, and can apply what I learn to work or side projects, then learning will feel less like a chore and become more of a game. \nI HATE reading.I could count on 2 fingers how many books I read front to back in high school and college. That‚Äôs bad I know, but in 2018 I read 5 books! Hooray me‚Ä¶ üòê. \nIn 2019 I am shooting to read 12 books. January was ‚Äú(Rich Dad, Poor Dad)[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0175P82RA]&quot;, and there will be a review post on this as I have a lot of likes and dislikes. These 12 books will be from all genres‚Ä¶ biographies, finance, history, sci-fi, etc. Before it was all self-help books and though they are great reads for motivation, all the good stuff came from the first 30% of the book.\nI read ‚Äú(The Three Body Problem)[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IQO403K]&quot; last year and was hooked the entire way through. So here‚Äôs to being more engaged in the readings I choose. \nHave any suggestions, let me know in the comments!\nBuild Build Build!!!As mentioned, this post is a month and a half late. I‚Äôve been focusing my time building things, and not just writing about what I‚Äôm panning on building.\nI built a monthly reminder app called (Resolution Tracker)[https://www.resolutiontracker.xyz/] that helps keep you honest with your New Years Resolutions.\nI‚Äôm also in the process of building a personalized newsletter to find events and news in your area.\nThese projects were the result of reading the book ‚Äú(Start Small, Stay Small)[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YH9MMI]&quot; by Rob Walling. It‚Äôs a great read if you want to use your programming skills to create a little side hussel while maintaining your primary job. I highly recommend it as it‚Äôs a quick read with a lot of great points. \nWrite it down!Hello to my loyal follower üëã! You may have noticed that this is a fresh blog. I should have ditched Wordpress/GoDaddy and switched to Github pages years ago.\nThis blog will hopefully be more active as I learn more, read more, and build more.\nSome posts may be quick posts where I learned something that I find useful. Others may be thoughtful epics. And who knows, maybe some music posts will come through. \nWrapping upSo if you read this post I thank you. But this was more of a personal post to myself, where I can look back and assess a year from now.\nSo Mike (speaking to myself), do these things and do them well: \n\nLearn as much as you can.\nDon‚Äôt become complacent.\nRead, build, write, repeat.\nGrow personally and professionally.\nHave fun!\n\nLets crush 2019!!","dateCreated":"2019-01-31T16:40:37-05:00","dateModified":"2019-02-11T09:52:57-05:00","datePublished":"2019-01-31T16:40:37-05:00","description":"","headline":"Starting things off - 2019","image":[],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.mikeymurph.com/Starting-Things-Off-2019/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mike Murphy","sameAs":["https://github.com/mikeymurph77","https://stackoverflow.com/users/3704250/mikeymurph77","https://twitter.com/mikeymurph77","https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmmurphy/","mailto:mikeymurph77@gmail.com"],"image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c27ce0a109e55da3c741b34781d03f6","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c27ce0a109e55da3c741b34781d03f6"}},"url":"https://www.mikeymurph.com/Starting-Things-Off-2019/"}</script>

<p>This blog will hopefully be more active as I learn more, read more, and build more.</p>
<p>Some posts may be quick posts where I learned something that I find useful. Others may be thoughtful epics. And who knows, maybe some music posts will come through. </p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-up"><a href="#Wrapping-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping up"></a>Wrapping up</h2><p>So if you read this post I thank you. But this was more of a personal post to myself, where I can look back and assess a year from now.</p>
<p>So Mike (speaking to myself), do these things and do them well: </p>
<ul>
<li>Learn as much as you can.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt become complacent.</li>
<li>Read, build, write, repeat.</li>
<li>Grow personally and professionally.</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ul>
