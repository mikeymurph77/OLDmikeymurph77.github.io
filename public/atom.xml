    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, ok I know what you’re thinking. “Mike it’s the middle of February. I think you missed the <em>‘Start’</em> of 2019”. Well you’re right, and we’ll get to that. But let’s just jump into it.</p><h2 id="It’s-not-you-it’s-me…"><a href="#It’s-not-you-it’s-me…" class="headerlink" title="It’s not you, it’s me…"></a>It’s not you, it’s me…</h2><p>I’ve been working professionally as a Ruby on Rails developer for 4 years now. It has been a great experience, and learning this language and framework has been life changing.</p><p>Call it a first love, comfort, or even complacency, but it’s about time that I move on to the next language/framework so I can continue to grow as a developer.</p><p>As microservices become more of the norm, it is best to dive head first into this new design technique.</p><p>2019 will be the year I take on learning and mastering Java, the Spring framework, and all the other technologies that surround the microservice ecosystem… Hello Kubernetes and Docker.</p><p>These technologies are battle tested and not going anywhere anytime soon. So it’s been fun Ruby/Rails, but I must spread my wings and fly.</p><h2 id="Grow-your-brain"><a href="#Grow-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="Grow your brain!"></a>Grow your brain!</h2><p>My father would always tell us to “Have fun and grow your brain!” before we went to school each day. I always thought this was a bit corny, but it was a good reminder that learning can be fun if you have the right perspective.</p><p>As I got older that message slipped and learning became a chore.</p><p>I’m starting 2019 with this message fresh in mind. I have a lot to learn, and yes some of these topics are as dry as Spongebob when he entered Sandy’s bio-dome without water. If I have the right perspective, and can apply what I learn at work or side projects, then learning will feel less like a chore and become more of a game.</p><h2 id="I-HATE-like-reading"><a href="#I-HATE-like-reading" class="headerlink" title="I HATE like reading."></a>I <del>HATE</del> like reading.</h2><p>I could count on 2 fingers how many books I read front to back in high school and college. That’s bad I know, but in 2018 I read 5 books! Hooray me… 😐.</p><p>In 2019 I am shooting to read 12 books. January was “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0175P82RA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a>“, and there will be a review post on this as I have a lot of likes and dislikes. These 12 books will be from all genres… biographies, finance, history, sci-fi, etc. Before it was all self-help books and though they are great reads for motivation, all the good stuff came from the first 30% of the book.</p><p>I read “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IQO403K" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Three Body Problem</a>“ last year and was hooked the entire way through. So here’s to being more engaged in the readings I choose.</p><p>Have any suggestions, let me know in the comments!</p><h2 id="Build-Build-Build"><a href="#Build-Build-Build" class="headerlink" title="Build Build Build!!!"></a>Build Build Build!!!</h2><p>As mentioned, this post is a month and a half late. I’ve been focusing my time building things, and not just writing about what I’m panning on building.</p><p>I built a monthly reminder app called <a href="https://www.resolutiontracker.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resolution Tracker</a> that helps keep you honest with your New Years Resolutions.</p><p>I’m also in the process of building a personalized newsletter to find events and news in your area.</p><p>These projects were the result of reading the book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YH9MMI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Start Small, Stay Small</a>“ by Rob Walling. It’s a great read if you want to use your programming skills to create a little side hussel while maintaining your primary job. I highly recommend it as it’s a quick read with a lot of great points.</p><h2 id="Write-it-down"><a href="#Write-it-down" class="headerlink" title="Write it down!"></a>Write it down!</h2><p>Hello to my loyal follower 👋! You may have noticed that this is a fresh blog. I should have ditched Wordpress/GoDaddy and switched to Github pages years ago.</p><p>This blog will hopefully be more active as I learn more, read more, and build more.</p><p>Some posts may be quick posts where I learned something that I find useful. Others may be thoughtful epics. And who knows, maybe some music posts will come through.</p><h2 id="Wrapping-up"><a href="#Wrapping-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping up"></a>Wrapping up</h2><p>So if you read this post I thank you. But this was more of a personal post to myself, where I can look back and assess a year from now.</p><p>So Mike (speaking to myself), do these things and do them well:</p><ul><li>Learn as much as you can.</li><li>Don’t become complacent.</li><li>Read, build, write, repeat.</li><li>Grow personally and professionally.</li><li>Have fun!</li></ul><h3 id="Lets-crush-2019"><a href="#Lets-crush-2019" class="headerlink" title="Lets crush 2019!!"></a>Lets crush 2019!!</h3>]]></content>
